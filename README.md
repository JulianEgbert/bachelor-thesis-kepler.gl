# bachelor-thesis-kepler.gl

This repository provides a webpage that can dynamically load the visualizations from kepler.gl. It also injects a valid mapbox key into the HTML files which is why they don't work on their own.

## Using HTML files without this webpage

If you want to use the .html files from the files folder without loading them in this webtool you need to inject your own mapbox token in the **PROVIDE_MAPBOX_TOKEN** field.
